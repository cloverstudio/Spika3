Spika is a communication platform that is fully customizable and open-source. Backend is developed in Typescript, specifically for organizations that prioritize data protection. Our application is based on Typescript / MySQL / RabbitMQ / ExpressJS / ReactJS, allowing for real-time conversations between colleagues, other companies, or customers, regardless of their mode of connection. Using our platform results in increased productivity and higher customer satisfaction rates.

We also have [iOS (Swift)](https://github.com/cloverstudio/SpikaiOS) and [Android (Kotlin)](https://github.com/cloverstudio/SpikaAndroid) client in another repository.
